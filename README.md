Master's student in Mathematics | Transformer theory | Stochastic Processes | scientific ML

I am a Master's student in mathematics with four years of research and scientific computing experience with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).  My areas of practical expertise include self-supervised image representation learning, offline reinforcement learning, time series analysis, transformers, High-Performance Computing (HPC), Python, and dozens of scientific ML libraries. My theoretical expertise lies in probability theory, measure theory, Bayesian statistics, linear algebra, functional analysis, logic and metalogic. I am seeking to apply my skills to atmospheric science and climate modeling.

**Research Interests**
-Stochastic Processes, especially ones that are difficult for transformers to learn and model.
-Predictive modeling, especially climate modeling.
-Probability logic and applications, i.e. the development of probability theory as extensions of formal logics.
